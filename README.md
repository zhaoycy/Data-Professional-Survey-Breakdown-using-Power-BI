**Goal**: To build an interactive report that provides an in-depth analysis of survey data collected from a data professional survey conducted by Alex the Analyst, visualising key metrics and various breakdowns.

**Description**: This project aimed to clean and standardise the survey data to ensure accurate analysis and representation. The survey dataset included fields such as job title, gender, salary, industry, country, and favorite programming language. Using Power Query in Excel, columns were split and values were replaced to standardize fields like job titles, industries, and salary. The goal was to produce a comprehensive dashboard with insights into the data professional community's demographic and salary trends.

**Skills**: Power Query, Data Standardisation & Transformation (Splitting Columns, Replacing Values), DAX (Calculated Columns, Calculated Measures), Visualisations (Card Visuals, Clustered Bar Charts, Treemaps, Donut Charts, Stacked Column Charts).

**Results**: The Power BI report provided a dynamic overview of the survey results. The card visuals allowed for quick insights into the survey's scale, while the clustered bar chart and donut chart gave clear comparisons of salary by job title and gender. The treemap highlighted regional distibution in survey responses, and the stacked column chart effectively visualised the popularity of various programming languages. This comprehensive analysis helped uncover key trends, such as salary disparities between genders and variations in salary across different job titles.
